          I draw from the diversity of human experiences to inform my coding
          practices. My journey as a developer is not just about writing code;
          it&apos;s about connecting technology with human behavior and cultural

          keyboards, hi-fidelity video games, football, and street photography.
          I&apos;m always on the lookout for another money trap... but these
          hobbies allow me to appreciate the little things while iterating until
          everything is just right.
